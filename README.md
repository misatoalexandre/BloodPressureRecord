BloodPressureRecord
===================

sqlite project

This is a blood pressure recoring app that uses sqlite to persist the user inputted data. 

It's in a working state, but I don't like how the model is not separated and in its own class. 
I also think that the more standard way of using sqlite is to create tables using Firefox SQLite plug in or Terminal. 
In this project, file  and table are created within xcode environment. 

In the next sqlite project, I would probably use Terminal to create a file and its tables, and even add values to the tables (if any). 
Then add the SQLite file to the bundle. 

I'm much used to the environemnt of Core Data so using SQLite felt new, but SQLite has its own advantage such as its portability, so it's great to know how integrating SQLite works.
